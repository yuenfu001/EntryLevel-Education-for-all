## Introduction
Welcome to the Donor Data Analysis Project README. This project involves the analysis of donor data to understand donor behavior, patterns, and preferences. The goal is to increase the number of donors, their frequency of donations, and the amount they donate. In this README, we will provide an overview of the project, insights gained from the analysis, and recommendations based on our findings.

## Professional Background
My name is Chiko Liu Abdulsamad, and I am a data analyst with a diverse professional background. I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Nigeria, in 2013. Over the years, I have transitioned from being a computer science instructor to working in sales and marketing in the telecommunications industry. However, my journey into data analysis began when I encountered a database management problem that I had to solve without prior expertise. I later became a public health analyst, creating databases and templates for health workers in the immunization program. I have also worked as an independent consultant, designing result management systems for educational institutions. Currently, I am studying to become a proficient data analyst in SQL and Tableau while being proficient in Python, Excel, and other tools.

## Project Overview
The Donor Data Analysis Project focuses on analyzing a database of donors and their donations. Our objectives include increasing the number of donors, the frequency of donations, and the donation amounts. We conducted a detailed analysis based on various factors, including gender, state, movie genre preferences, car types, and job fields. These factors were chosen based on their potential impact on donor behavior.

## Root Cause Analysis
We used a root cause analysis process to delve into the reasons behind the need to increase donations. By asking questions and analyzing data, we aimed to uncover the underlying causes of the fundraising challenges.

## Insights from Analysis
Here are some key insights obtained from the analysis:

1. **Analysis by Gender:** Male donors contributed more donations compared to their female counterparts.

2. **Analysis by State:** States like California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Virginia had higher donation totals than others.

3. **Analysis by Movie Genre:** Donors who preferred drama, comedy, and documentary genres contributed more than those with other preferences.

4. **Analysis by Car Types:** Donors with less expensive cars, such as Ford, Toyota, and Chevrolet, gave significantly more donations than those with luxury cars.

5. **Analysis by Job Fields:** While job fields were considered, there were no significant differences in donation amounts based on job fields.

6. **Dashboard:** A dashboard was created to visualize the analysis results.

## Findings and Recommendations
Based on our analysis, we offer the following recommendations:

1. **Address Null Values:** Develop data collection processes that account for null values to ensure data accuracy.

2. **Evaluate Redundant Data:** Reevaluate the inclusion of redundant datasets and focus on collecting meaningful data.

3. **Capture Timeframe:** Include a timeframe for datasets to provide context for analysis.

4. **Consider Missing Data:** Identify and collect missing datasets that may provide additional insights.

5. **Target Awareness:** Focus on increasing awareness and sensitization efforts in states that donated significantly less.

This project demonstrates adaptability, problem-solving skills, and a commitment to learning. Continuing to build skills in data analysis and relevant tools will contribute to a successful career in this field.
